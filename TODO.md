# Video Call Session Auto-Start Implementation

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Backend Changes (consumers.py)
- [x] Added imports for LiveSession and SessionParticipant models
- [x] Added `track_participant_connection()` method to track when users join
- [x] Added `track_participant_disconnection()` method to track when users leave
- [x] Added `check_and_start_session()` async method to check for both parties
- [x] Added `_check_session_participants()` database method to verify participants
- [x] Added `session_started()` handler to send notifications to clients
- [x] Modified `connect()` to track participant connections
- [x] Modified `disconnect()` to track participant disconnections
- [x] Modified `user_joined()` to trigger session start check

### Frontend Changes (live-session.html)
- [x] Added 'session_started' case to `handleWebSocketMessage()` switch
- [x] Added `handleSessionStarted()` function to:
  - Hide waiting room
  - Update session status display
  - Show system message about session starting

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Participant Tracking**: When a user connects, their participation is tracked in the `SessionParticipant` model
2. **Role Detection**: System determines if user is 'student' or 'counselor' based on appointment relationship
3. **Session Monitoring**: When any user joins, system checks if both student and counselor are connected
4. **Auto-Start**: If both parties are present and session is in 'waiting' status, automatically:
   - Changes session status to 'active'
   - Sets `actual_start` timestamp
   - Notifies all connected clients
5. **UI Updates**: Frontend receives notification and:
   - Hides waiting room
   - Updates status display
   - Shows confirmation message

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test with real users (student and counselor)
- [ ] Verify session starts immediately when both join
- [ ] Check that waiting room disappears automatically
- [ ] Confirm session status updates correctly
- [ ] Test edge cases (one user leaves and rejoins)
- [ ] Verify WebRTC connection still works after auto-start

## 🚀 Expected Behavior

**Before Fix:**
- Client joins → Session status: 'waiting' → Waiting room shown
- Counselor joins → Session status remains 'waiting' → Manual intervention required

**After Fix:**
- Client joins → Session status: 'waiting' → Waiting room shown
- Counselor joins → Both parties detected → Session status: 'active' → Video call starts immediately

## 📝 Notes

- Uses existing `SessionParticipant` model for tracking
- Maintains backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Automatic detection eliminates need for manual session start
