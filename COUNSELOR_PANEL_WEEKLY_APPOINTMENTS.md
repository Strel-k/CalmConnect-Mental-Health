# Counselor Panel Weekly Appointments Implementation

## Overview

Successfully modified the counselor panel to display **all appointments for the current week** instead of just today's appointments, providing counselors with a better overview of their upcoming schedule.

## Changes Made

### **1. Backend Changes (views.py)**

**Modified `counselor_dashboard` view:**

**Before:**
```python
# Get today's appointments
today_appointments = Appointment.objects.filter(
    counselor=counselor,
    date=today
).order_by('time')
```

**After:**
```python
# Get appointments for the current week (Monday to Sunday)
start_of_week = today - timedelta(days=today.weekday())
end_of_week = start_of_week + timedelta(days=6)

# Get this week's appointments
this_week_appointments = Appointment.objects.filter(
    counselor=counselor,
    date__range=[start_of_week, end_of_week],
    status__in=['pending', 'confirmed']
).order_by('date', 'time')
```

**Key Improvements:**
- **Date Range**: Shows appointments from Monday to Sunday of current week
- **Status Filtering**: Only shows pending and confirmed appointments (excludes completed/cancelled)
- **Better Ordering**: Orders by date first, then time for logical display
- **Week Context**: Added `week_start` and `week_end` to template context

### **2. Frontend Changes (counselor-panel.html)**

**Updated Section Headers:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<h3>Today's Appointments</h3>
<h3 id="appointments-heading"><i class="bx bxs-time"></i> Today's Appointments</h3>

<!-- After -->
<h3>This Week's Appointments</h3>
<h3 id="appointments-heading"><i class="bx bxs-time"></i> This Week's Appointments</h3>
```

**Enhanced Appointment Display:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<div class="appointment-time">{{ appointment.time|time:"g:i A" }}</div>

<!-- After -->
<div class="appointment-time">
  <div class="appointment-date">{{ appointment.date|date:"M d" }}</div>
  <div class="appointment-time-only">{{ appointment.time|time:"g:i A" }}</div>
</div>
```

**Updated Empty State:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<h4>No appointments scheduled for today</h4>

<!-- After -->
<h4>No appointments scheduled for this week</h4>
```

### **3. CSS Styling Enhancements**

**New CSS Classes:**
```css
.appointment-time {
  /* Enhanced layout for date + time */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.3rem;
  padding: 0.8rem 1rem;
  min-width: 90px;
}

.appointment-date {
  font-size: 0.8rem;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.5px;
}

.appointment-time-only {
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: white;
}
```

## Benefits

### **1. Better Planning**
- **Weekly Overview**: Counselors can see all appointments for the week at once
- **Better Scheduling**: Easier to plan and manage weekly workload
- **Reduced Navigation**: No need to check individual days

### **2. Improved User Experience**
- **Visual Clarity**: Date and time clearly displayed for each appointment
- **Logical Ordering**: Appointments sorted by date, then time
- **Status Awareness**: Only shows relevant appointments (pending/confirmed)

### **3. Professional Appearance**
- **Clean Design**: Date and time stacked vertically in appointment cards
- **Consistent Styling**: Maintains existing design language
- **Responsive Layout**: Works well on different screen sizes

## Technical Details

### **Date Range Calculation**
```python
start_of_week = today - timedelta(days=today.weekday())  # Monday
end_of_week = start_of_week + timedelta(days=6)          # Sunday
```

### **Database Query Optimization**
- **Efficient Filtering**: Uses `date__range` for optimal database performance
- **Status Filtering**: Only fetches relevant appointment statuses
- **Proper Ordering**: `order_by('date', 'time')` for logical display

### **Template Compatibility**
- **Backward Compatible**: Kept `today_appointments` variable name for template compatibility
- **Enhanced Display**: Added date information without breaking existing functionality
- **Graceful Fallback**: Proper empty state handling
